[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.3.0] - 2025-01-14

### Added
- In-game chat messages are now displayed in chat bubbles above players heads!
- Custom player icons (icons can be embedded in player skin file)
  - Step-by-Step **Icon** Tutorial: [ICON.md](ICONS.md)
  - Mixin to extend PlayerSkinTexture to make a copy of the NativeImage + pixel toggle to enable
- New command `/creaturechat chatbubbles set <on | off>` to show or hide player chat messages in bubbles
- Improved LLM Unit tests (to prevent rate limit issues from certain providers when running all tests)
  - Check friendship direction (+ or -) in LLM unit tests (to verify friendship direction is output correctly)

### Changed
- Seperated Player and Entity message broadcasts (different packets for simplicity)
- Reduced size of player skin face on chat bubble, to match sizes of custom icons (for consistency)
- Updated entity icons for allay, creeper, and pig

### Fixed
- Hide death messages for mobs with no chat data
- Fixed transparent background behind chat screen for Minecraft 1.20 and 1.20.1.
- Removed extra message broadcast (which was unnecessary)

## [1.2.1] - 2025-01-01

### Changed
- Refactor of EntityChatData constructor (no need for playerName anymore)
- Improved LLM / AI Options in README.md (to more clearly separate free and paid options)
- Improved LLM unit tests for UNFLEE (trying to prevent failures for brave archer)

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug which broadcasts too many death messages (any mob with a custom name). Now it must also have a character sheet.
- Prevent crash due to missing texture when max friend/enemy + right click on entity
- Fixed bug which caused a max friend to interact with both off hand + main hand, causing both a message + riding (only check main hand now)
- Hide auto-generated messages from briefly appearing from the mob (i.e. interact, show, attack, arrival)
- Name tags were hidden for entities with no character sheet (they are now rendered)

## [1.2.0] - 2024-12-28

### Added
- New friendship particles (hearts + fire) to indicate when friendship changes
- Added sound effects for max friendship and max enemy
- New follow, flee, attack, lead, and protect particles & sound effects (for easy confirmation of behaviors)

- New sounds and particles when max friendship with EnderDragon (plus XP drop)
- New `/creaturechat story` command to customize the character creation and chat prompts with custom text.

### Changed
- Entity chat data now separates friendship by player and includes timestamps
- When entity conversations switch players, a message is added for clarity (so the entity knows a new player entered the conversation)
- Data is no longer deleted on entity death, and instead a "death" timestamp is recorded
- Removed "pirate" speaking style and a few <non-response> outputs
- Passive entities no longer emit damage particles when attacking, they emit custom attack particles
- Protect now auto sets friendship to 1 (if <= 0), to prevent entity from attacking and protecting at the same time
- Seperated `generateCharacter()` and `generateMessage()` functions for simplicity
- Fixing PACKET_S2C_MESSAGE from crashing a newly logging on player, if they receive that message first.
- Added NULL checks on client message listeners (to prevent crashes for invalid or uninitialized clients)
- Broadcast ALL player friendships with each message update (to keep client in sync with server)
