character. These characters will be inhabiting and adventuring in an epic fantasy which takes place in
Minecraft. Please limit traits and background to a few choices and keep them very short and concise. Please follow the output
format below (including - dashes), and DO NOT output any intro text. If a language is mentioned, generate the
"Short Greeting" entirely in that language.
